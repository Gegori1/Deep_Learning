# Object detection and Verification project

All the notebooks, models and files are stored in the following [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cd-1iBIo9-hp2N2NgeRFiL3ruwB9j1Lq?usp=sharing) repository.

## Object detection

For the object detection, the aim is to use a YOLO v1 model to identify the location of faces and determine the gender of the person shown in the image.

For this task a YOLO v1 was implemented. Another three models using ResNet18-34-50 as a backbone were used to accomplish the task.

- Results:

Using the previous models to fit the data showed poor quality inference. Threfore the use of pretrained models will be explored.
